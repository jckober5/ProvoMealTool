Every time my wife and I go on a date it is my job to decide where we should go and eat. This has been a struggle since there are so many places to eat near where we live. I created this tool to help us decide where to eat and to help introduce us to new places as well.

This survey is aimed to gather insights into people’s preferences, considerations, and decision-making factors when selecting a dining destination near Provo Utah. By analyzing the responses, we gained valuable information to guide individuals in making informed choices about where to enjoy their meals. We gather data utilizing R on a Shiny application deployed on shinyapps.io. Code for this project is provided in a Github Repository. Insights are then shown on Tableau Public.

In this we consider Cuisine Preferences, Price Range, Atmosphere, and Convenience as we provide recommendations on where to eat. Participants’ preferences varied widely, with cuisine options, dietary considerations, price range, ambience, and recommendations all playing a significant role. By understanding these key factors, individuals can make more informed choices when deciding where to eat, ensuring an enjoyable dining experience that aligns with their preferences and requirements.
